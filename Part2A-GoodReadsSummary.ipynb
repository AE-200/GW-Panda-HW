To do this, the Authors column is selected and using the unique() attribute of the dataframe, a list of the unique authors is obtained.  The len function of lists is utilized to get the total number of unique authors and assign this to the variable author_count. Next, an analysis of the publication year data is done by looking at the earliest year of publication for the books and the latest years respectively.  To do this, the Publication Year column of the dataframe is selected and the .min() function used to determine the earliest year and similarly, the .max() function to get the latest year.  These are respectively assigned to earliest_year and latest_year respectively. Next, to calculate the total reviews all the resepctive rating columns need to be totalled.  Seeing that each book has from one to five star ratings for its reviews, to find the total reviews, using iloc, start at the column index 4 (which is the fifth column in the file and the column which has one star ratings) and for the remaining columns(2 star to five star ratings), add the number of reviews on a column by column basis (since sum(axis=1)) and put this is in a column called \"Total Reviews\".  Finally, get the total of this row by using the sum function and assign this to a variable total_reviews.]_"
